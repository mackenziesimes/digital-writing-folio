Taroko Gorge remix: Maria Engberg 'Alone Engaged'

What aspects of the remix are the same?
- The word formatting and coding are the same, the blank layout is also reminiscent of the original

What aspects of the remix are different?
- The words and "plot" of the poem are different, the background is also a different colour.
- 
Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
- The remix seems very derivitive and doesnt build on anything from the original, merely copying the format identically and changing the words.
