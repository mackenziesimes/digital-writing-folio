- sometimes poetry

### What tools do you use to write?

- I use microsoft word
- listen to music to garner inspiration
- Use techniques from film surrounding dialogue and speaking to create a voice in my work

### How do these tools shape the way you write? 
- use microsoft word, I edit as I go so the digital platform works well for me
- The music allows me to create images and scenarios when writing fiction
- it inspires characters, settings, senses, and plots
- film inspires voice for me and the portrayal of information

### How do these tools shape the way you write?
- I am able to get my ideas out quickly without confusion as the digital platform allows me to edit as I write, a habit I've formed from a young age.
- Constrains my ability to plan out structures or fully realise self contained pieces of writing.
