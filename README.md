- Use techniques from film surrounding dialogue and speaking to create a voice in my work

### How do these tools shape the way you write? 
- use microsoft word, I edit as I go so the digital platform works well for me
- The music allows me to create images and scenarios when writing fiction
- it inspires characters, settings, senses, and plots
- film inspires voice for me and the portrayal of information

### How do these tools shape the way you write?
- I am able to get my ideas out quickly without confusion as the digital platform allows me to edit as I write, a habit I've formed from a young age.
- Constrains my ability to plan out structures or fully realise self contained pieces of writing.

Taroko Gorge(s)

Taroko Gorge remix: Maria Engberg 'Alone Engaged'

What aspects of the remix are the same?
- The word formatting and coding are the same, the blank layout is also reminiscent of the original

What aspects of the remix are different?
- The words and "plot" of the poem are different, the background is also a different colour.
- 
Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
- The remix seems very derivitive and doesnt build on anything from the original, merely copying the format identically and changing the words.
