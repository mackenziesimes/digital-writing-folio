### How is hypertext fiction different from fiction?
- Hypertext alters the linearity of the story, the control over the order or unearthing of the story allows for different outcomes and experiences, rather than one that you get from fiction. Although there are layers and subtext within both, the experience of the hypertext allows for personalisation, consumption, and becoming complicit as a reader. 

### How is hypertext different from games?
